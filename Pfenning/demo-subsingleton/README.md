# Demo of SubSingleton

On 2019-06-22 a demo of SubSingleton logic was given by Professor Pfenning.
This directory contains (partial) implementations of the code we saw then (plus the implementation of `compress`).

The source of SubSingleton can be found on BitBucket:

At the moment of the presentation, we were on commit: [`a9d4f7a4b051f17d60020d887c29ad101cb50d92`](https://bitbucket.org/fpfenning/subsingleton/src/a9d4f7a4b051f17d60020d887c29ad101cb50d92/)
